# Features
- convert to ICalendar (.ics) format, used for easy export on popular calendar tools like Google Calendar
- convert to CSV, in a calendar style format, for users that do not use any calendar tools. 

*Tip: it's a good idea to set the end date to the last day of their semester. This way, the recurring events will automatically stop when the semester ends.*
