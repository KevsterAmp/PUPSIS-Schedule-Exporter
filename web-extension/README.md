## Building the extension
This contains the necessary scripts to build and publish web extensions for various browsers including Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge) and Gecko-based browsers (Firefox).

### Prerequisites

- A Linux environment (any distribution) or WSL
- Bash installed
- Make installed

To build the extension for different browsers, you can use the `Makefile` provided. Navigate to the `web-extension` directory of the project and run the following commands:

#### Building for Specific Browsers (unpacked)
Unpacked builds are used for local testing and development. You can generate browser-specific extensions as follows:
Use the `make` command followed by the target browser:

- **Chrome** (Chromium-based): 
```bash
make chrome
```
- **Microsoft Edge version**
```bash
make edge
```
- **Firefox (Manifest V2)**
```bash
  make firefox
```
- **Creating all platforms Chrome and Firefox browsers**
```
make unpacked
```

#### Building for Specific Browsers (zipped)
To generate compressed packages for the browser platforms such as `.zip` for chrome-based and `.xpi` for firefox:

- **Chrome** (Chromium-based): 
```bash
make chrome-publish
```
- **Microsoft Edge version**
```bash
make edge-publish
```
- **Firefox (Manifest V2)**
```bash
make firefox-publish
```
- **Creating all platforms Chrome and Firefox browsers**
```
make publish
```
The output of the build will be placed in the `dist/build` directory.

#### Deleting the generated extension in dist folder

To remove the generated files from the dist/build directory, run the following command:
```bash
make clean
```

## File Directories

The project is organized into the following directories and files to streamline the development, building, and publishing process:

- `src/`  
  This directory contains common assets used across all browser platforms, including:
  - **HTML**: Structure and layout for the extension's user interface.
  - **CSS**: Stylesheets for the extension's appearance.
  - **Frontend JS**: JavaScript files for handling client-side functionality.

- `platform/`  
  This folder holds browser-specific files that vary between platforms. These include:
  - **Main JS**: Platform-specific logic, such as fetching the schedule or interacting with browser APIs.
  - **manifest.json**: The manifest file tailored to the respective browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and its required manifest version (V2 or V3).

- `dist/`  
  The directory where built extensions and other generated files are stored:
  - `dist/build/`: The main output folder for the extensions generated by the `Makefile`. Each build is placed here for easy access during development and publishing.
  - `version`: This file keeps track of the current version number of the extension.

- `tools/`  
  Backend scripts and utilities used by the `Makefile` to automate the building and packaging process. This includes platform-specific build scripts to compile the extension based on the target browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
